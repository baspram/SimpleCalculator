# SimpleCalculator
Back to basic project #1. Implement simple calculator project and improve as we go. I'll document my progress in this readme and hopefully learn something new along the way.

## Stack
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as package manager. I use npm and yarn at work, but I want to a learn a few things since I want to explore npx and create npm package in the future.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as module bundler (also task runner, lol). The benefit of using webpack is undeniable. If you haven't use webpack you're missing out on things like transformation, tree shaking and code splitting.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) as Javascirpt framework for SPA. I use Vue at work and I want to learn about Vue Native (hopefully) in this project.
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for enhanced css. I don't have any preference on this, i just use it and love it.
